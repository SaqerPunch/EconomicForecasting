**Economic Forecasting Project in RStudio**

This repository contains the work done for my economic forecasting project, completed during my economics class. The project utilizes RStudio to analyze and forecast various economic indicators using time series analysis, regression models, and machine learning techniques.

**Overview**
The project aims to:

Analyze historical economic data (e.g., GDP, inflation rates, unemployment rates).
Apply different forecasting methods to predict future trends.
Use models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Linear Regression to forecast key economic indicators.
The project includes data analysis, model selection, performance evaluation, and visualization of forecast results.

**Requirements**
To run this project, you will need:

R (version 4.0 or higher)
RStudio (optional, but recommended for an enhanced experience)
Necessary R packages (listed in the install.R script)
